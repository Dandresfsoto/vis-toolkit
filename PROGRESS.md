# Annotations

* Combining multiple charts together?

# UI elements

* Data-driven UI elements
* Connect with the chart

* Filter
* Aggregate
* Time update

* Show highlighted element
* Show selected elements + reset

* Charts options such as to change the type of scale (absolute vs relative)

* Either from the visualization itself, or with auto-generated widgets
* Binding with external buttons/widgets
