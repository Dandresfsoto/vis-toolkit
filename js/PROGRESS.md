# Foundations

[ ] Data management
[ ] Data wrangling functions
[ ] Extract common functionalities
[ ] Dealine with missing data
 
Ex. data structure for sparklines
// {name: d.dept_name, year: parseDate(d.year), realgdp: d.realgdp}

## Interactions

[ ] Use of dispatch events
[ ] Hightlight: should implement the class `.highligthed`
[ ] Selection: should implement the class  `.selected`
